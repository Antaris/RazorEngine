Thanks that you want to help! Please read the sections below.

## Contributing (General)

If you want to send a bug report just open a new issue!

Otherwise just fork the project an send a pull request to discuss and merge the changes.
If you want to discuss the changes beforehand you can open a new issue.
Even better when there is already an open issue marked as [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine/labels/up-for-grabs).
Please send the pull request against the `master` branch and mention an already existing issue (if present).

This project is searching for new maintainers, so if you want to help write on gitter or start sending PRs :)

## Contributing Documentation

As the documentation is generated from the repository you can help improving the documentation by editing the files in the `/doc` folder.
You can even edit a page directly on github by clicking the edit button ([for example this page](https://github.com/Antaris/RazorEngine/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).
See also https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/ 
(don't forget to send a pull request back after forking and changing something).

## Branching model

The branching model in http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ is used (which you do not need to read to send a pull request).
However the naming differs: `develop`is called `master` and `master` is called `releases` in RazorEngine.
